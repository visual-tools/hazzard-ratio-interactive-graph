	<h1>Hazard Ratio</h1>
	<p class="text-sm">
		A hazard ratio is a way of comparing how quickly something happens in one group (here, people
		who were diagnosed with COVID-19) compared with another group (people who were not diagnosed
		with COVID-19) over time. A hazard ratio of 1 means there is no difference between the groups. A
		hazard ratio greater than 1 means the outcome is more common in people who were diagnosed with
		COVID-19. A hazard ratio less than 1 means the outcome is less common in people who were
		diagnosed with COVID-19. Each hazard ratio is accompanied by a confidence interval. Confidence
		intervals show the range of values that the true hazard ratio is likely to fall within.
